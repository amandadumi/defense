  abstract = {Transition to renewable energy systems is essential to achieve the climate change mitigation targets. However, the timing and the regions of the production and consumption of the renewable energy do not always match, and different energy storage technologies are needed to secure the uninterrupted energy supply. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a flexible media for the storage and transportation of renewable energy. These ``liquid hydrogen batteries'' are reversibly hydrogenated and dehydrogenated using catalysts at elevated temperatures. Commercial LOHC concepts are already available. Another flexible route to store energy is through ``circular'' hydrogen carriers, such as methanol and methane produced from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). These fuels have a long history as fossil fuels. In this review, the chemistry and state-of-the-art of LOHCs are explored and discussed against defined criteria with comparison made to existing energy storage systems. The LOHCs and ``circular'' hydrogen carriers were found to be particularly promising hydrogen storage systems.},

  abstract = {The accurate computation of forces and other energy derivatives has been a long-standing challenge for quantum Monte Carlo methods. A number of technical obstacles contribute to this challenge. We discuss how these obstacles can be removed with the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach. AFQMC is a general, high-accuracy, many-body total-energy method for molecules and solids. The implementation of back-propagation for pure estimators allows direct calculation of gradients of the energy via the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. A planewave basis with norm-conserving pseudopotentials is used for the study of periodic bulk materials. Completeness of the planewave basis minimizes the effect of so-called Pulay terms. The ionic pseudopotentials, which can be incorporated in AFQMC in exactly the same manner as in standard independent-electron methods, regulate the force and stress estimators and eliminate any potential divergence of the Monte Carlo variances. The resulting approach allows applications of full geometry optimizations in bulk materials. It also paves the way for many-body computations of the phonon spectrum in solids.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for spectral clustering based on a column-pivoted QR factorization that may be directly used for cluster assignment or to provide an initial guess for k-means. Our algorithm is simple to implement, direct and requires no initial guess. Furthermore, it scales linearly in the number of nodes of the graph and a randomized variant provides significant computational gains. Provided the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors used for clustering contains a basis that resembles the set of indicator vectors on the clusters, we prove that both our deterministic and randomized algorithms recover a basis close to the indicators in Frobenius norm. We also experimentally demonstrate that the performance of our algorithm tracks recent information theoretic bounds for exact recovery in the stochastic block model. Finally, we explore the performance of our algorithm when applied to a real-world graph.}

  abstract = {G4MP2 theory has proven to be a reliable and accurate quantum chemical composite method for the calculation of molecular energies using an approximation based on second-order perturbation theory to lower computational costs compared to G4 theory. However, it has been found to have significantly increased errors when applied to larger organic molecules with 10 or more nonhydrogen atoms. We report here on an investigation of the cause of the failure of G4MP2 theory for such larger molecules. One source of error is found to be the ``higher-level correction (HLC)'', which is meant to correct for deficiencies in correlation contributions to the calculated energies. This is because the HLC assumes that the contribution is independent of the element and the type of bonding involved, both of which become more important with larger molecules. We address this problem by adding an atom-specific correction, dependent on atom type but not bond type, to the higher-level correction. We find that a G4MP2 method that incorporates this modification of the higher-level correction, referred to as G4MP2A, becomes as accurate as G4 theory (for computing enthalpies of formation) for a test set of molecules with less than 10 nonhydrogen atoms as well as a set with 10-14 such atoms, the set of molecules considered here, with a much lower computational cost. The G4MP2A method is also found to significantly improve ionization potentials and electron affinities. Finally, we implemented the G4MP2A energies in a machine learning method to predict molecular energies.},

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks developed for adsorption energy prediction on molybdenum carbide catalysts provide a significant acceleration over density functional theory calculations.           ,                             A priori               catalyst design guidelines from first principles simulations and reliable data-driven models are essential for cost efficient catalyst discovery. Nonetheless, acquiring all properties that control catalytic activity and stability is computationally challenging due to the complex interactions among reactants, intermediates, and products at the active sites. Therefore, predictions of only the most relevant catalytic properties, or catalyst descriptors, are often used to guide new catalyst design. In the context of upgrading biomass materials               via               deoxygenation reaction to value-added chemicals, the molybdenum carbides (Mo               2               C) have been considered among the most active and economically viable catalysts. Unfortunately, one of the bottlenecks related to longer term stability of Mo               2               C catalysts is the susceptibility to surface oxidation, a common problem in heterogeneous catalysis, which requires the use of excess hydrogen for active site regeneration. By using surface dopants to tune the oxygen affinity (catalyst descriptor) of Mo               2               C surfaces, it is possible to design new doped Mo               2               C catalysts with desired reactivity and stability. Here, we first employed periodic density functional theory to perform 20\,000 high-throughput VASP simulations of oxygen binding energies (BE               O               ) on various pristine and doped Mo               2               C surfaces. We computed and developed a binding energy database of 20\,000 oxygen adsorption structures consisting of 7 low Miller-index surfaces, 23 d-block elements as single-atom dopants, all possible surface terminations, dopant locations, and adsorption sites. Utilizing this dataset, we developed a message passing neural network (MPNN) machine learning model for extremely fast BE               O               prediction using only unoptimized local adsorption geometries as inputs. The best model yields a mean absolute error of 0.176 eV for BE               O               with respect to computed values from DFT. Our results highlight the use of MPNN as an accurate and broadly applicable machine learning approach to accelerate descriptor-based catalyst discovery.},

  abstract = {Summary Various computational schemes hidden under the name EOM-CC (equation-of-motion coupled-cluster) create a path through which the CC theory is applied to investigate excited, ionized and electron-attached molecular systems. In this chapter we consider five realizations of the EOM-CC approach focused on the studies of electronic excitations (EE), ionization potentials (IP), electron-attached (EA) states, double ionization potentials (DIP) and double-electron-attached (DEA) states. The direct application of the considered methods allows to study electronic states of the reference system as well as those differing from the reference by one (IP, EA) or two (DIP, DEA) electrons. In addition we propose an indirect application of the EOM-CC schemes which in some cases may be more interesting than the direct one. Namely, when the open-shell system A is studied then we may adopt as the reference one of its charged analogues: A+, A-, A2+, A2-on condition that it represents the closed-shell structure implying using the restricted Hartree-Fock (HF) reference. Then to recover the data relevant to the neutral system A we need to apply the EA, IP, DEA or DIP variant of the EOM-CC scheme, respectively. This can be generalized in the following way: to study with the EOM-CC approach the system A (charged or neutral) we may select as the reference that form of A which is of closed-shell character and differs from A by no more than 2 electrons. Then by using one of the EOM variants listed above we may recover an original structure. Owing to that we may avoid calculations based on the potentially spin-contaminated unrestricted HF reference. Moreover, the DIP and DEA approaches open the way to describe in a correct way a homolytic dissociation of the single bond without necessity to deal with the open-shell products. For all five considered methods (i.e., EE-EOM-CC, IP-EOM-CC, DIP-EOM-CC, EA-EOM-CC, DEA-EOM-CC) we provide detailed working equations both at the CCSD and CCSDT level in the form ready to code. For each of the considered EOM schemes we give illustrative results which make it possible to compare the performance of the E0M-CCSD and EOM-CCSDT approaches.},

  abstract = {Summary The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), originally introduced by White in 1992 in solid state physics, has since found numerous applications in quantum chemistry. DMRG allows one to approximate the full CI wave function with polynomial scaling, making active spaces with about 100 orbitals accessible. Together with self-consistent field orbital optimization (DMRG-SCF), it allows for much larger active spaces than the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the theory behind DMRG, both in the original renormalization group formulation, as well as in the more modern formulation where wave functions and operators are represented as matrix product states and matrix product operators, respectively. We further discuss quantum-information-theoretical orbital entanglement measures that are accessible through DMRG, which pave the way to automated active space selection in multicongurational calculations, and factors that control DMRG convergence and accuracy. Finally, we review modern developments in and around DMRG, such as post-DMRG methods for the description of dynamic correlation and environment effects, tensor network states, as well as applications of DMRG and DMRG-SCF in quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {Summary Quantum Monte Carlo methods are first-principle approaches that approximately solve the Schr\"odinger equation stochastically. As compared to traditional quantum chemistry methods, they offer important advantages such as the ability to handle a large variety of many-body wave functions, the favorable scaling with the number of particles, and the intrinsic parallelism of the algorithms which are particularly suitable to modern massively parallel computers. In this chapter, we focus on the two quantum Monte Carlo approaches most widely used for electronic structure problems, namely, the variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods. We give particular attention to the recent progress in the techniques for the optimization of the wave function, a challenging and important step to achieve accurate results in both the ground and the excited state. We conclude with an overview of the current status of excited-state calculations for molecular systems, demonstrating the potential of quantum Monte Carlo methods in this field of applications.},

  abstract = {Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet, the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the Cori II super-computer using 8, 192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every scale.},

  abstract = {Finite size error is commonly removed from coupled cluster theory calculations by \$N\^\{-1\}\$ extrapolations over correlation energy calculations of different system sizes (\$N\$), where the \$N\^\{-1\}\$ scaling comes from the total energy. However, previous studies in the quantum Monte Carlo community suggest an exchange-energy-like power law of \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ is also be present in the correlation energy when using the conventional Coulomb interaction. The rationale for this is that the total energy goes as \$N\^\{-1\}\$ and the exchange energy as \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$; so, the correlation energy should be a combination of the two power laws. Further, in coupled cluster theory, these power laws are related to the low \$G\$ scaling of the transition structure factor, \$S(G)\$, which is a property of the coupled cluster wavefunction calculated from the amplitudes. We show that data from coupled cluster doubles calculations on the uniform electron gas(UEG) fit a function with a low \$G\$ behavior of \$S(G)\$\textasciitilde\$G\$. The pre-factor for this linear term is derived from the exchange energy to be consistent with an \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ power law at large \$N\$. Incorporating the exchange structure factor into the transition structure factor results in a combined structure factor of \$S(G)\$\textasciitilde\$G\^2\$, consistent with an \$N\^\{-1\}\$ scaling of the exchange-correlation energy. We then look for the presence of an \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ power law in the energy. First, we develop a plane-wave cutoff scheme with less noise than the traditional basis set used for the UEG. Then, we collect data from a wide range of electron numbers and densities to systematically test 5 methods using \$N\^\{-1\}\$ scaling, \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ scaling, or combinations of both scaling behaviors. We find that power laws that incorporate both \$N\^\{-1\}\$ and \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ scaling perform better than either alone, especially when the pre-factor for \$N\^\{-2/3\}\$ scaling can be found from exchange energy calculations.},

  abstract = {Summary Various computational schemes hidden under the name EOM-CC (equation-of-motion coupled-cluster) create a path through which the CC theory is applied to investigate excited, ionized and electron-attached molecular systems. In this chapter we consider five realizations of the EOM-CC approach focused on the studies of electronic excitations (EE), ionization potentials (IP), electron-attached (EA) states, double ionization potentials (DIP) and double-electron-attached (DEA) states. The direct application of the considered methods allows to study electronic states of the reference system as well as those differing from the reference by one (IP, EA) or two (DIP, DEA) electrons. In addition we propose an indirect application of the EOM-CC schemes which in some cases may be more interesting than the direct one. Namely, when the open-shell system A is studied then we may adopt as the reference one of its charged analogues: A+, A?, A2+, A2?on condition that it represents the closed-shell structure implying using the restricted Hartree-Fock (HF) reference. Then to recover the data relevant to the neutral system A we need to apply the EA, IP, DEA or DIP variant of the EOM-CC scheme, respectively. This can be generalized in the following way: to study with the EOM-CC approach the system A (charged or neutral) we may select as the reference that form of A which is of closed-shell character and differs from A by no more than 2 electrons. Then by using one of the EOM variants listed above we may recover an original structure. Owing to that we may avoid calculations based on the potentially spin-contaminated unrestricted HF reference. Moreover, the DIP and DEA approaches open the way to describe in a correct way a homolytic dissociation of the single bond without necessity to deal with the open-shell products. For all five considered methods (i.e., EE-EOM-CC, IP-EOM-CC, DIP-EOM-CC, EA-EOM-CC, DEA-EOM-CC) we provide detailed working equations both at the CCSD and CCSDT level in the form ready to code. For each of the considered EOM schemes we give illustrative results which make it possible to compare the performance of the E0M-CCSD and EOM-CCSDT approaches.},

  abstract = {The DLPNO-CCSD(T) method is designed to study large molecular systems at significantly reduced cost relative to its canonical counterpart. However, the error in this approach is also size-extensive and relies on cancellation of errors for the calculation of relative energies. This work provides a direct comparison of canonical CCSD(T) and TightPNO DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations of reaction energies and barriers of a broad range of chemical reactions. The dataset includes acidities, anion binding affinities, enolization, Diels-Alder, nucleophilic substitution, and atom transfer reactions and complements existing theoretical datasets in terms of system size as well as new reaction types (e.g., anion binding affinities and chlorine atom transfer reactions). The performance of DLPNO-CCSD(T) was further examined with respect to systematic variation of basis set and system size and amounts of nonbonded interaction present in the system. The errors in the DLPNO-CCSD(T) were found to be relatively insensitive to the choice of basis set for small systems but increase monotonically with system size. Additionally, calculations of barriers appear to be more challenging than reaction energies with errors exceeding 5 kJ mol-1 for many Diels-Alder reactions. Further tests on three realistic organic reactions reveal the impact of the DLPNO approximation in calculating absolute and relative barriers that are important for predictions such as stereoselectivity.},

  abstract = {Stochastic and mixed stochastic-deterministic density functional theory (DFT) are promising new approaches for the calculation of the equation-of-state and transport properties in materials under extreme conditions. In the intermediate warm dense matter regime, a state between correlated condensed matter and kinetic plasma, electrons can range from being highly localized around nuclei to delocalized over the whole simulation cell. The plane-wave basis pseudo-potential approach is thus the typical tool of choice for modeling such systems at the DFT level. Unfortunately, the stochastic DFT methods scale as the square of the maximum plane-wave energy in this basis. To reduce the effect of this scaling, and improve the overall description of the electrons within the pseudo-potential approximation, we present stochastic and mixed DFT developed and implemented within the projector augmented wave formalism. We compare results between the different DFT approaches for both single-point and molecular dynamics trajectories and present calculations of self-diffusion coefficients of solid density carbon from 1 to 50 eV.},

This can be applied to quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This new formula has the great merit that the decomposition parameters of higher order are all positive except the term S3.}

  abstract = {The continued development of novel many-body approaches to ground-state problems in physics and chemistry calls for a consistent way to assess its overall progress. Here we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide the most extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems to date, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy, and novel algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods towards quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.},

  abstract = {"Introduced as a quantum extension of Maxwell's classical theory, quantum electrodynamics has been the first example of a quantum field theory (QFT). Eventually, QFT has become the framework for the discussion of all fundamental interactions at the microscopic scale except, possibly, gravity. More surprisingly, it has also provided a framework for the understanding of second order phase transitions in statistical mechanics. In fact, as hopefully this work illustrates, QFT is the natural framework for the discussion of most systems involving an infinite number of degrees of freedom with local couplings. These systems range from cold Bose gases at the condensation temperature (about ten nanokelvin) to conventional phase transitions (from a few degrees to several hundred) and high energy particle physics up to a TeV, altogether more than twenty orders of magnitude in the energy scale. Therefore, although excellent textbooks about QFT had already been published, I thought, many years ago, that it might not be completely worthless to present a work in which the strong formal relations between particle physics and the theory of critical phenomena are systematically emphasized. This option explains some of the choices made in the presentation. A formulation in terms of field integrals has been adopted to study the properties of QFT. The language of partition and correlation functions has been used throughout, even in applications of QFT to particle physics. Renormalization and renormalization group properties are systematically discussed. The notion of effective field theory and the emergence of renormalisable theories are described. The consequences for fine tuning and triviality issue are emphasized. This fifth edition has been updated and fully revised"--},
